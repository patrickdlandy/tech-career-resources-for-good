# Resources for a positively impactful tech career 

"Positively impactful" means two things in this context:

- You are using your time and/or resources to solve problems in a way that is consistent with your own ethics/morality
- Your work feels meaningful and is sustainable for you in terms of mental/physical health, engagement, and balance


## Getting your first job out of a software Bootcamp

- I attended App Academy, and their recommended approach to the job search worked for me.
- Projects
- Resume
- Platforms
- Application quota per week (Network vs cover letters vs just resume uploads)
- Interview Practice
- Networking
- What are they going to remember about you? (One GREAT answer: having a specific altruistic goal.)


## Finding the right personal fit in a job

- Personality type matters! 
- Some roles are client-facing, some involve management. Some are more isolated and code-centered. Most roles require teamwork or collaboration in some fashion. 
- Pair programming is an excellent way to build collaborations skills if you have not already done so
- Get away from the mindset that technical roles are superior to more people-oriented roles. You will probably end up doing both throughout your career. There any many types of jobs that require software engineering knowledge that are less technical: recruiting, sales, management, finance, HR, SCRUM. 

## Making a positive impact with your career

- There are a lot of problems to solve. Many of them intersect with each other. Some are intuitive (global poverty) and some are less so (Artificial Intelligence risks).
- The problem(s) you choose to work on may be ones you are already interested in (for example, I am primarily interested in solving the problem of climate change). You may already have a strong interest in focusing on a set of problems, and that is great!
- You may need to take some time to think about what problems you want to work on. Or even prioritize.
