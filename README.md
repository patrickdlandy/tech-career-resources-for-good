# Resources for a positively impactful tech career 

This list of resources is intended to be a thought-provoking reference point for early-career software developers looking to make a positive impact in the world. It is brief and by no means complete, and there are countless causes, organizations, resources, and experiences not represented here. I personally found many of these resources helpful during my career transition into tech with an ethical focus, and I hope it helps you in your own explorations.
